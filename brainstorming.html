    <h1>Brainstorming</h1>
 
    <p> To get started, get in a group of four and discuss what you know, or 
    you think you know, about video games and violence. Your initial discussion 
    should be based around the following points:
    </p> 
    <p>
    <ol>
     <li>examples of violent games you know/play</li>
     <li>the type of violence, i.e. fighting, shooting etc...</li>
     <li>what you feel when playing these violent games</li>
     <li>any real world cases of violence that have been related to video 
     games</li>
     <li>your initial thoughts about the influence of violent games on 
     behaviour.</li>
    </ol>
